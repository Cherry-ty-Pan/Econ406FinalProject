# Econ406FinalProject
  Heart disease, also called cardiovascular disease, generally refers to the conditions involving blocked blood vessels that eventually lead to a heart attack.
According to the CDC, one person dies every 36 seconds in the United States from cardiovascular disease, and cardiovascular diseases are the number 1 cause of
death globally. Personally, I am interested in this topic since I have a family history of heart disease, thus I want to learn more about this. This project aims
to better understand the impact of different variables on heart disease, and to make a prediction on chances of getting heart disease using logistic regression
based on these variables/factors.

  The dataset that I used is “heart.csv”. This dataset is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
