    Heart disease, also called cardiovascular disease, generally refers to the conditions involving blocked blood vessels that eventually lead to a heart attack. According to the CDC, one person dies every 36 seconds in the United States from cardiovascular disease, and cardiovascular diseases are the number 1 cause of death globally. This project aims to better understand the impact of different variables on heart disease, and to make a prediction on chances of getting heart disease using logistic regression based on these variables/factors.
    The dataset that I used is “heart.csv”. This dataset is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
